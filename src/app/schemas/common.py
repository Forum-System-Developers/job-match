    """
    Pydantic schema for pagination and filtering parameters.

    This schema is designed to handle standard query parameters
    for limiting and offsetting results in paginated responses.

    Attributes:
        limit (int): The maximum number of records to return.
            - Default: 100
            - Constraints: Must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100.
        offset (int): The number of records to skip before starting to return results.
            - Default: 0
            - Constraints: Must be greater than or equal to 0.

    Example:
        Use this schema in FastAPI endpoints to simplify pagination:

        ```
        @app.get("/items/")
        def get_items (FilterParams = Depends()):
            ...
        ```
    """

    limit: int = Field(default=10, gt=0, le=100)
    offset: int = Field(default=0, ge=0)
